# Voice-activated-teleprompter
This is a voice-activated teleprompter provided to me by James Baker from telepromptermirror.com. I asked him if he would share the source for the one hosted on his website so people could improve it, and he was happy to share the source. I sent a follow-up email asking if he had any preference for the license it should be released under and if he could let me know which parts of the code he wrote himself. He did not reply.

Clearly there's some jquery and potentially other stuff that falls under it's own licensing so at some point someone will have to add those licenses in.

I think with minimal work this could be a solid teleprompter solution for a lot of people, it just needs to be cleaned up a bit and a few more options for customizing it.
